# User Story Splitting Exercise

Take the below Large User Story (or let’s call it a feature) and decompose or split this into smaller user stories with different concepts you have learned in this course.

_Application:_ You work for a file sharing and management company named EasyShare that has a web application as well as a mobile app (iOS & Android). Your team is focused on creating a feature that helps users manage and share files or documents (pictures, video, and word documents). Imagine, EasyShare is a dropbox or google drive like application.

_Original User Story:_

> As a content owner,
> I want to organize, manage and share documents
> so that I can manage my documents
>
> Acceptance Criteria:
>
> - Content owner can upload content to their library within the application
> - Content Owner can access the content they own
> - Content owner can search through the content they have on the application
> - Content owner can share the content through someone’s email or a unique link

_Assumptions:_ Users will be able to use this feature in a laptop (on browsers Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and mobile device (iOS and android)

- Split this user story into small stories. You may do this activity in your personal notebook with an actual pen. Or you can type it into Microsoft word, excel, notepad or any electronic tool of your choice
- Think about how you would break this feature into smaller user stories and what approach would you take? Jot it down.
- Now that you have a splitting technique or approach in mind, start writing the user stories. Also, include acceptance criteria in these.
- Also, list any other assumptions that you might make in this scenario.
