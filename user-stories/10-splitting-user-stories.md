> Complex or huge user stories is like eat an elephant

1. Optimizes and focuses on the 20% of the work that is highly valueble.
2. Deprioritizes the stories that are not so valuable.
3. Splitting a user story can help the team to gain visibility and clarity into its true size.

# Techniques

1. Splitting with Simplicity
   - Star with the simplest thing that could potentially work (One of the Agile Principles)
2. Splitting the user's story with Workflow Steps
   - Think of the all the steps (or action) that a user takes while using a feature or a product. Map out the steps visually and then break all the individual steps as a story.
3. Splitting with CRUD (Create, Read, Updated and Delete)
   - CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. If you have a large user story, simply split the user story with the function of creating, reading, updating and deleting.
4. Splitting by Entry Methods - Data Entry Methods
   - Think about different ways you can enter data or information (example date, picture or price) into a system. Each way to enter data or information can be split into a user story
5. Splitting with SPIKE.
   - If you have a complex user story and the team doesnâ€™t know how to get started (or estimate it) on the work, team can split the user story into spikes where you can investigate different ways to solve that problem or tools to use.
