# INVEST Criteria

1. I for Independent |
   > Whenever possible, avoid dependencies between stories.
   > Could this user story be developed independent of another user story?
   > Tip: Watch for stories that can be blocked by work that must be completed by someone else.
2. N for Negotiable |
   > A user story is the reminder to have a conversation. Its
   > recommended not to add too much details so that it allows for improvisation while implementing if changes arise.
   > Tip: Avoid getting too detailed with the requirements, or solutioning or describing how the work should be done, how should some from the team.
3. V for Valuable |
   > Each story adds something useful for the end user. Recommendation is each story should be connected to clear business goals.
4. E for Estimable |
   > It should be estimable, if you can’t estimate, consider breaking
   > the story into smaller stories or better understand what value it’s meant to add. If it’s not breakable or if you cannot understand the value, then explore unknown tech in a time- boxed research spike.
   > Tip: watch out for stories that are too large, vague or difficult to estimate
5. S for Small |
   > Make sure the story is small enough to be done in a single iteration. Its recommended it shouldn’t take more than few days to compete a single user story.
   > Tip: Watch out for stories that are too big, or not properly broken down into smaller chunks.
6. T for Testable |
   > Should include some acceptance criteria to be able to consider the story “done”. See if the user story can be demonstrated on its own
   > Tip: It’s recommended the story can be individually tested.
